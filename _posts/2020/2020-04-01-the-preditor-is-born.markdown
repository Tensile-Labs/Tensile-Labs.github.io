Thanks to the intuitive design prEditor is not only suited for experienced engineers but also for those on their journey of becoming one!

Features:
- Editor for analyzing Beam Profiles
- Calculates Center of Gravity and Moments of Inertia in Real-Time
- Comprehensible Menu
- Intuitive Examination of Tensions with Mohr's Circle
- Every single parameter is independently adjustable

This App has been developed by four creative students with consultation of the Institute for Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design (SLA) at RWTH Aachen University in Germany.
