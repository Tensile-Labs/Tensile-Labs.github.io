With prEditor you can now design and thoroughly analyze beam profiles on the go. Not only can you calculate the Moment of Inertia and Center of Gravity in real time but examine the different stress conditions in MohrÂ´s Circle easily.

Thanks to the intuitive design prEditor is not only suited for experienced engineers but for those on their journey of becoming one as well!

Features:
- Editor for beam profiles analysis
- Calculates center of gravity and moments of inertia in real-time
- Comprehensive menu
- Intuitive examination of tensions with Mohr's Circle
- Independent adjustment of evey single parameter

This App has been developed by four creative students with consultation from the Institute for Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design (SLA) at RWTH Aachen University in Germany.
