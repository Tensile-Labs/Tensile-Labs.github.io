Profile Editor is a mobile application developed by four Students from RWTH Aachen University for a targeted use in educational and engineering environments. The app currently consits of a Beam Designer and a digital implementation MohrsÂ´ Circle. Our goal is to publish the application to the three most commonly used App Stores by Apple, Google and Microsoft  by the end of April.
